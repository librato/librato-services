Librato Services
================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/librato/librato-services.png)](http://travis-ci.org/librato/librato-services)

Service hooks for [Librato Metrics](https://metrics.librato.com).

Service Lifecycle
-----------------

1. When a request to create a service is received by the API, the
   API calls the method `receive_validate` for the appropriate
   service class.
1. The service `receive_validate` method should validate the settings
   parameters. This method should return false with a set of invalid
   parameters if the settings are not correct for the service type.
1. Later, when a metric measurement is posted to the API that exceeds a
   configured alert threshold, the API records the exception.
1. A background job checks every minute for any alerts that have been
   triggered.
1. If any alerts have been triggered, the background job generates a
   POST to
   `https://<services-server>/services/<service_name>/alert.json` with
   the post data:
   - `params[:settings]`: the options the user specified in the Service configuration
   - `params[:payload]`: the event data for the triggered alert
1. A [sinatra][] app [lib/librato_services/app.rb][] decodes the request
   and dispatches it to a registered service if it exists

Writing a Service
-----------------

All services are found in the [services/][] directory. They must have a method
named `receive_alert` that is called when an alert is matched.

The settings are available as a `Hash` in the instance method `settings` and
the event payload is available as a `Hash` in the instance method `payload`.

Tests should accompany all services and are located in the [services/][]
directory.

Payload
-------

A sample payload is available at
[lib/librato-services/helpers/alert_helpers.rb] and listed below:

```
'payload' : {
        'alert' : {
                'name' : 'Alert name or nil',
                'id' : 12345,
        },
        'metric' : {
                 'name' : 'Name of the metric that tripped alert',
                 'type' : 'gauge' or 'counter',
        },
        'measurements' : [{
                 'value' : 4.5 (value that caused exception),
                 'source' : 'r3.acme.com' (source that caused exception
                                           or 'unassigned')
        }]
}
```

Sample Service
--------------

Here's a simple service that posts the measurement value(s) that
triggered the alert.

```ruby
class Service::Sample < Service
  def receive_validate(errors = {})
    if settings[:name].to_s.empty?
      errors[:name] = "Is required"
      return false
    else
      return true
    end
  end

  def receive_alert
    http_post 'https://sample-service.com/post.json' do |req|
      req.body = {
        settings[:name] => payload[:measurements]
      }
    end
  end
end
```

Contributing
------------
